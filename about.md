Hi, I'm Beau.  I live in San Diego with my girlfriend and our two pug children.

I've been writing software professionally for over 15 years and have worked for early stage startups to Fortune 500s.  My life as a developer started in enterprise health care using primarily C++ and C#.  Over the past several years I transitioned to working on the modern web using tooling such as Rails, React, and AngularJS.  This I truly love.

This blog is a collection of things I've devised to help navigate the modern web dev landscape.  It will be primarily Rails focused, at least to start.  Hope you find it of value!
